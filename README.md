# :candy: Sweet Memories

This is a simple E-commerce backend application. To Showcase my skils in Ruby, Active Records, Sintra API and SQLite. 

## :page_facing_up: Overview

In this project, using Sintra and Ruby for the backend and React and Material UI for the frontend, I created a retro candy storefront. This application allows customers to pick from several old-fashioned candies, place them in their cart, and checkout. After placing their order, customers can also delete any candy that they may no longer desire. 

## :sparkler: Features
